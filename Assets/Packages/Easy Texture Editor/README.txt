INFO:
This package contains several useful tools that every unity developer needs. 
Using the Quick Editor tool you can adjust Brightness, Contrast, Gamma, Exposure, Saturation, Hue .. of any PNG, JPEG or TGA texture in your engine. 
There is also 23 blending modes to blend your textures with colors or other textures! 
All of that is possible with REAL TIME preview INSIDE your scene. Using the channel packer you can easily create custom maps for your materials, as well as create maps for the standard unity shaders in HDRP, URP and legacy renderer. 
With the Transform tool, you can easily rotate or mirror your images. 
All of the image effects run on GPU with COMPUTE SHADERS, so it's all very fast and fluid. Stay tuned for more content with future updates.
